Project Proposal:
Measuring Political Freedom Around the World
By: Joe Despres A44775954, Joe Sigler A52842027, Jacob Haywood ?, Sabrina Ball A53376769
Question of Motivation
What political factors affect people’s civil liberties and personal freedoms? We feel that civil and political freedoms are essential to a good life. Therefore, we would like to know what factors would be helpful in predicting how much political freedom the citizens of a country have.
Summary information about the data (number of observations, brief summary of each variable, where the data is from, etc)
Here we obtained a dataset provided by gapminder.We obtained 11 different univariate datasets and merged them together using R.

Data is available in some capacity for 58,000 country-years, with some countries having data back 100+ years.

Our response terms are:
"Cliberities_fh": a measure of a nation’s civil liberties, assessed by 15 indicators, grouped into 4 groups: Freedom of Expression and Belief, Associational and Organizational Rights, Rule of Law, Personal Autonomy and Individual Rights.

"Polrights_fh": a measure of a nation’s political rights, assessed by 10 indicators, grouped into 3 subcategories: Electoral Process, Political Pluralism and Participation, and Functioning Government

"Freedix_fh": a measure of a nation’s freedom, taken as the average of civil liberties and political rights, ranging on a scale of 1 (most free) to 7 (least free)

Covariates:
"country, year, electricity_use_per_person, gini, internet_users, journakilled, life_expectancy_years, military_spending_pct_of_gdp, murder_per_mil_people, primary_school_completion, "

gini is a measure of income inequality across a population. A high gini index indicates high income inequality.

journakilled is the number of journalists killed in that country in a given year.

The rest of the variables are explained easily by their names.
